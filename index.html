            <h3><b>About the workshop</b></h3>
            <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The NYC Cybersecurity Day workshop is organized by New York University (NYU) in collaboration with universities in the NYC area, including CUNY, Columbia, Cornell, and NYU. The event is primarily organized by students, with sponsorship from Google and NYU's Center for Cybersecurity. Our goal is to unite experts from the NYC region to discuss the future of cybersecurity. This workshop will be the first workshop of the series. The workshop would be a half-day event  taking place at NYU Brooklyn's hub for technology and art, bringing together a distinguished group of leading scholars and experts specializing in various aspects of human elements in cybersecurity. Discussions will delve into vital topics such as privacy, network management, ethics in AI systems, legal considerations, and more.</p>
            <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The workshop's agenda includes three invited talks, with each panelist delivering a short, informal, 30-minute presentation, followed by engaging discussions among participants. Attendees will have the opportunities to actively participate in these discussions and share their valuable insights. For a comprehensive schedule and further details regarding the workshop's speakers and participants, please refer to the information provided below.</p>

                <p><b>Abstract</b>
                    <br> Information technologies (IT) are extensively integrated within the critical infrastructures upon
                            which society depends. The reliance on IT has been increasing dramatically with the
                            introduction of critical infrastructure technologies such as autonomous vehicles in
                            transportation, automated electric power grids, and water and wastewater automated controls
                            and detection systems. These developments make cybersecurity increasingly important to
                            protect these infrastructures. The ways people react to and behave with respect to cyber
                            threats is an often subtle, unrecognized, and overlooked element in supporting these systems
                            and must be confronted to enhance cybersecurity for these infrastructures. 
                    <br> As a foundation for understanding the role of human behavior in cybersecurity for critical
                            infrastructures, the infiltration and integration of IT into critical infrastructures is first identified
                            along with the history of cyber intrusions in these infrastructures. Second, a typology of human
                            behavior with respect to infrastructure in general and the security of IT in these infrastructures
                            is put forth ranging from no action to dramatically changing the usage of those infrastructures.
                            Human behavior in general influences the performance of critical infrastructures irrespective of
                            IT and the extensive literature on human behavior with respect to critical infrastructures is
                            extrapolated to human behavior with respect to cyber security. Third, ways in which infiltration
                            of perpetrators into these domains can occur are identified from numerous cases or
                            conceptualized where data are unavailable and how human behavior reacts to these threats is
                            put forth, for example, often redirecting how the infrastructures are used. Fourth, how
                            behaviors are shaped by the nature and severity of cyber-driven accidents, the cost of exposure
                            and avoidance, and the existence of safeguards and regulations to prevent accidents are
                            discussed. Finally, behavior is deeply engrained in larger social psychological factors that shape
                            attitudes, perceptions, beliefs, and actions based upon them. These range from fear and dread
                            to the need to control unknown risks. These factors are introduced as possible explanations for
                            human behavior with respect to cyber security.
